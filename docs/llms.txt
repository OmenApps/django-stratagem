# django-stratagem

> Registry-based plugin architecture for Django. Define registries of
> implementations that are auto-discovered at startup, stored in model fields,
> and exposed through forms, admin, DRF, and template tags. Supports
> conditional availability, hierarchical registries, and third-party plugins.
